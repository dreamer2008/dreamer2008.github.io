# Why I'm willing to relocate to Germany


## Why I'm willing to relocate to Germany

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, like most Chinese people, I had never been to Germany or any other developed country. **I was just curious about Germany and fascinated by its industrial products and culture**, I had a travel plan that was disrupted by the pandemic. If you ask this question at this point, I would answer like below.

* **For a sustainable career**. WLB(work-life balance) is not as common as in Germany, I don't think it's sustainable. FYI: [996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system) and there is discrimination based on age/gender. 

* **For freedom**. There is more freedom in Germany.

But now, after a six-month stay in Germany between August 2023 and January 2024, **I would add that I'm so sure that I like living in Germany and I'm willing to relocate.**

### Workplace Culture

The working culture in the IT industry of Germany is so different from that in China. I have heard this before and confirmed this through the people I know. 

* **There are so many jobs with WLB(work-life balance)**, which is not common in China. I don't like complaining, but I'm just telling the truth. **This is also one of the most important reasons why I want to work in Germany. **

* There are so many remote/hybrid jobs, which is not common in China. Most employers in China require employees to work on-site.

* There are more possibilities. There are more chances to work in an international and diverse team. This sounds exciting to me.

* Most if not all interviews are conducted online, which is not so common in China especially after China relieved its pandemic restrictions.

* And even the working hours in a week are flexible and customizable, which is unimaginable in China.

### People

When I lived in a WG, one of my flatmates and his friends were very hospitable and often invited me to join them, including inviting me to the Christmas party, which was my first time celebrating Christmas. We became friends and we keep in touch.

When I went to grocery stores, the workers were very polite and patient.

When I was on a train/subway/bus, I could hear so many different languages.

When my phone was dead and I asked for directions, people were always helpful even if they didn't speak English.

When I walk with my friend on a street, there are not so many people as in China. I like it.

### Climate

The climate in Germany is more moderate than in the northern part of China, where I have been living for the most of time in my life. There are cooler summers and warmer winters and I even got cold immediately when I returned to China. It is too cold in winter in North China.

It gets dark earlier in winter here than in China, but it is not a problem for me. At night, I talk to my flatmates, eat out, or stay at home to relax.

### Transport

There are no security checks if you take a train/subway/bus in Germany. This is so cool because security checks could be very time-consuming, especially in big cities like Beijing in China, it can be very crowded.

Germany is not very big, so its cities are more accessible. I like it.

And, Germany is located in the center of Europe, so you can travel to other European countries from Germany easily. It was a pity that I did not get such a chance.


### Food
As a Chinese, I would say Chinese food is different from German/European/Western food. **But I was so surprised to find that the food in Berlin is as diverse as its people**. There are Chinese, Italian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Indian, and foods from many other countries and cultures. When it is possible, I eat out at restaurants with my friends.

In most cases, Chinese food needs hot water and is very time-consuming. So I don't cook in China and have take-out food almost every day. But they are too greasy and not healthy. And sometimes there are even food safety problems. 

Maybe you cannot imagine that **I LOVE bread in Germany, especially brezel and the buns**. In China, most bread is sweet toasts.

I like the fast food in Germany, e.g. sushi, rice boxes, pizza, and ready-to-go food. They are convenient when you don't have much time to cook.

Although there are no 24/7 convenience stores like 711 in Germany, I like the grocery stores/supermarkets in Germany, there are so many different stores.

### Environmental Protection

* Garbage Sorting. There are trash bins with different colors.
* **Returnning Bottles. This is one of my favorite things in Germany**.
* Surprise bags, e.g. Too good to go. This could reduce food waste.

### Medium-size City

Berlin is the largest city in Germany in terms of population. But when it is compared to Beijing, it is a much smaller city, which I like. It's less crowded
and more accessible no matter where you are in the city.

## A Little Story
Once a time when I went to a baker's shop to pick up my Too Good To Go surprise bag, I encountered three little girls who failed to buy food because of budget problems. When I got my surprise bag, I let them pick three pieces of bread they liked and they thanked me. I was so glad that I could help.

## What I went through in the past two years

My grandmother passed away in January 2023 and my father passed away in February 2024. I spent a lot of time taking care of them before losing them. I was so saddened.
