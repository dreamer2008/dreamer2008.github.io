# Why I'm willing to relocate to Germany


## Why I'm willing to relocate to Germany

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, like most Chinese people, I had never visited Germany or any other European country. **I was simply curious about Germany,  captivated by its industrial products and culture**, I had a travel plan that was unfortunately disrupted by the pandemic. Before the pandemic, I would answer as follows.

* **For a sustainable career**. WLB(work-life balance) is not as common in China as it is in Germany, I don't think it's a sustainable way in China. 

* **For freedom**. There is more freedom in Germany.

However, after a six-month stay in Germany between August 2023 and January 2024, **I am confident to say that I like living in Germany and I'm willing to relocate.**

### Workplace Culture

The working culture in the IT industry of Germany is significantly different from that in China. I have heard this before and confirmed this through my connections.

* **There are so many jobs with WLB(work-life balance)**, which is not common in China. **This is also one of the most important reasons why I want to work in Germany. **

* There are many more PTO(Paid Time Off) in Germany than in China. 

* There are so many remote/hybrid jobs, which is not common in China. Most employers in China require employees to work on-site.

* There are more possibilities. There are more chances to work in an international and diverse team. This sounds exciting to me.

* Most if not all interviews are conducted online, which is not so common in China especially after China removed its pandemic restrictions.

* And even the working hours in a week are flexible and customizable, which is unimaginable in China.

### People

When I lived in a shared apartment(WG), one of my flatmates and his friends were very hospitable and often invited me to join them, including the Christmas party, which was my first time celebrating Christmas. We became friends, and we still keep in touch.

When I went to grocery stores, the cashiers were very polite and patient.

When I was on a train/subway/bus, I could hear so many different languages.

When my phone was dead and I asked for directions, people were always helpful even if they didn't speak English.

When I walked with my friend on a street, I found fewer people than in China. I like it.

### Climate

The climate in Germany is more moderate than in the northern part of China, where I have spent the majority of my life. Germany has cooler summers and warmer winters and I got cold immediately when I returned to China. It is too cold in winter in North China.

It gets dark earlier in winter here than in China, but it is not a problem for me. At night, I talk to my flatmates, eat out, walk around with my friends, or stay at home to relax.

### Transport

In Germany, there are no security checks when taking a train/subway/bus. This is so convenient because security checks can be very time-consuming, especially in big cities like Beijing in China, which can be super crowded.

Germany's compact size makes its cities highly accessible, a feature I appreciate.

Situated in the heart of Europe, Germany offers easy travel to other European countries. Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to take advantage of this during my stay.


### Food
As a Chinese, I would say Chinese food is so different from German/European/Western food. **But I was so surprised to find that the food in Berlin is as diverse as its people**. There are Chinese, Italian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Indian, and foods from many other countries and cultures. When it is possible, I dine out at restaurants with my friends.

In most cases, Chinese food needs hot water and is very time-consuming. So I don't cook in China and have take-out food almost every day. But they tend to be  greasy and not healthy. And sometimes there are even food safety problems. 

Maybe you cannot imagine that **I LOVE bread in Germany, especially Brezel and the buns**. In China, most bread is sweet toasts.

I like the fast food in Germany, e.g. sushi, rice boxes, pizza, and ready-to-go food. They are convenient when time is limited for cooking.

Although Germany has no 24/7 convenience stores like 7-Eleven, I admire the diversity of stores/supermarkets in Germany.

### Environmental Protection

* Garbage Sorting. There are trash bins with different colors.
* **Returnning Bottles**. This is one of my favorite practices in Germany.
* Surprise Bags, e.g. Too good to go. This could reduce food waste.

### Medium-sized City

Although Berlin is the largest city in Germany in terms of population, it is a smaller city than Beijing, which I find preferable. It is less crowded
and more accessible no matter where you are in the city.

## A Little Story
One day when picking up my Too Good To Go surprise bag from a baker's shop, I encountered three little girls who failed to buy food because of budget problems. Upon receiving my surprise bag, I let them pick three pieces of bread they liked, and they thanked me. I was so glad that I could help.
