# Why I'm willing to relocate to Germany


## Three Major Reasons

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, like most Chinese people, I had never visited Germany or any other European country. I had a travel plan that was unfortunately disrupted by the pandemic. 

So, why I'm willing to relocate to Germany? There are three major reasons.

* Curiosity about German industrial products and culture. Germany is renowned for "Made in Germany" products, e.g. cars.

* For a sustainable career. WLB(work-life balance) is not as common in China as it is in Germany, I don't think the working style in China is sustainable for employees. 

* For freedom. There is more freedom in Germany and people have more access to the Internet and other countries.

Also, after a five-month stay in Germany between August 2023 and January 2024, **I am pretty sure that I like living in Germany and I would love to relocate.**

### Workplace Culture

The working culture in the IT industry of Germany is significantly different from that in China. I have heard this before and confirmed this through my connections.

* **There are so many jobs with WLB(work-life balance)**, which is not common in China. **This is also one of the most important reasons why I want to work in Germany. **

* There are many more PTOs(Paid Time Off) in Germany than in China. 

* There are so many remote/hybrid jobs, which is not common in China. Most employers in China require employees to work on-site.

* There are more possibilities. There are more chances to work in an international and diverse team. This sounds exciting to me.

* Most if not all interviews are conducted online, which is not so common in China especially after China removed its pandemic restrictions.

* And the working hours in a week are flexible and negotiable, which is unimaginable in China.

### People

When I lived in a shared apartment(WG) in Berlin-Lichtenberg, one of my flatmates and his friends were very hospitable and often invited me to join them, including [the Christmas party](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uur3eIchZ9o17bIjqfYZrEeYA8q4exPo), which was my first time celebrating Christmas. We became friends, and we still keep in touch.

When I went to grocery stores, the cashiers were very polite and patient.

When I was on a train/subway/bus, I could hear so many different languages.

When my phone was dead and I asked for directions on a street, people were always helpful even if some of them didn't speak English.

When I walked with my friend on a street, I found fewer people than in China. I like it. There are too many people in China, especially in big cities.

### Cultural Resources

Firstly, there are so many tourist attractions in Germany (I visited Berlin and Dresden) including landmarks and museums.

Secondly, there are also many international fairs/exhibitions and tech conferences in Berlin and in Germany. During my stay, I visited IFA Berlin 2023.

Thirdly, on major festivals, there are many activities to celebrate them. For example, I visited some places for [the Festival of Lights](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1NgfUNIrQA33igDDLA3VufydVhICf-bS9), they were beautiful.
I joined [the gala at Brandenburg on New Year eve](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1YHLMbPnUGk6VV-KP7ouhzNT4Art541kz), the vibe was amazing.
I also attended some [Christmas Markets(Weihnachtsmarkt)](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19j90K9q4Mre97qOibyqv8oz3wD4GRqYN) to feel the vibe.

If I can live in Germany, there will be many such things for me to explore.

### Air & Climate

The air quality in Germany is much better than that in China. And the sky is bluer too. I feel more comfortable than I do in China. The climate in Germany is more moderate than in North China, where I have spent the majority of my life so far. Germany has cooler summers and warmer winters and I got cold immediately when I returned to China. It was too cold in winter in North China.

It gets dark earlier in winter here than in China, but it is not a problem for me. At night, I talk to my flatmates, eat out, walk around with my friends, or stay at home to relax.


### Transport

In Germany, there are no security checks when taking a train/subway/bus. This is so convenient because security checks can be very time-consuming, especially in big cities like Beijing in China, which can be super crowded.

Germany's compact size makes its cities highly accessible. I like it.

I like the shared bikes on the street and I used them for a couple of times.

I'm also curious about the shared scooters, but did not get a chance to use them.

Situated in the heart of Europe, Germany offers easy access to other European countries. Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to take advantage of this during my stay.


### Food
As a Chinese, I would say Chinese food is so different from German/Western food. **But I was so surprised to find that the food in Berlin is as diverse as its people**. There are Chinese, Italian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Indian, and foods from many other countries and cultures. When it is possible, I dine out at restaurants with my friends.

In most cases, Chinese food needs hot water and is very time-consuming. So, I don't often cook in China and order take-out food. But they tend to be greasy and not healthy. And sometimes there are even food safety problems. 

Maybe you cannot imagine that **I LOVE [bread in Germany](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1nuLCIGBz4RJGPIufpNxDVEGaO4ZWhaDy), especially Brezel and the buns**. In China, most bread is sweet toasts.

I like the fast food in Germany, e.g. sushi, rice boxes, pizza, and ready-to-go food. They are so convenient if you don't want to cook.

Although Germany has no 24/7 convenience stores like 7-Eleven, I think the grocery stores/supermarkets(e.g. Lidl, Edeka, Aldi, Rewe, Kaufland, dm) in Germany is good enough for shopping. The conveyors in the supermarkets are cool and convenient.

### Environmental Protection

* Garbage Sorting. There are [trash bins](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=139Ev17wlY8_5zE7H4-4SWqF-kkQpa2Im) with different colors.

* **Returning Bottles**. This is one of my favorite things in Germany.
* Surprise Bags, e.g. Too good to go. This could reduce food waste.

### Medium-sized City

Although Berlin is the largest city in Germany in terms of population, it is a much smaller city than Beijing(BJ has a population of over 20 million). It is less crowded and more accessible no matter where you are in the city.


## A Little Story
One day when picking up my Too Good To Go surprise bag from a baker's shop, I encountered three little girls who failed to buy food because of budget problems. Upon receiving my surprise bag, I asked them to pick three pieces of bread they liked, and they thanked me. I was so glad that I could help.
