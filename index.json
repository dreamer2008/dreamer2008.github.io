It was my first time to visit Germany/Europe in 2023. So, why would I love to relocate to Germany? There are three major reasons. For curiosity. I’m so curious about German industrial products and culture. Germany is renowned for “Made in Germany” products, e.g. cars. Germany has also produced many philosophers, scientists, mathematicians, and musicians. For a sustainable career. WLB(work-life balance) is rare in China. I don’t think the working culture in China is sustainable for most employees. For freedom. There is more freedom in Germany and people have free access to the Internet and new technical products. All my friends in Germany believe their lives are better than those in China. Also, after a five-month stay in Germany. I am confident that I like living in Germany and I would love to relocate.

I have heard this before and confirmed this through my connections. There are so many jobs with WLB(work-life balance), which is not common in China. **This is also one of the most important reasons why I want to work in Germany. ** There are many more PTOs(Paid Time Off) in Germany than in China. There are so many remote/hybrid jobs, which is not common in China. Most employers in China require employees to work on-site. There are more possibilities. There are more chances to work in an international and diverse team. This sounds exciting to me. Most if not all interviews are conducted online, which is not so common in China especially after China removed its pandemic restrictions. And the working hours in a week are flexible and negotiable, which is unimaginable in China.

But I was so surprised to find that the food in Berlin is as diverse as its people. There are Chinese, Italian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Indian, and foods from many other countries and cultures. When it is possible, I dine out at restaurants with my friends. In most cases, Chinese food needs hot water and is very time-consuming. So, I don’t often cook in China and order take-out food. But they tend to be greasy and not healthy. And sometimes there are even food safety problems. Maybe you cannot imagine that I LOVE bread in Germany, especially Brezel and the buns. In China, most bread is sweet toasts. I like the fast food in Germany, e.g. sushi, rice boxes, pizza, and ready-to-go food. They are so convenient if you don’t want to cook. Although Germany has no 24/7 convenience stores like 7-Eleven, I think the grocery stores/supermarkets(e.g. Lidl, Edeka, Aldi, Rewe, Kaufland, dm) in Germany is good enough for shopping. The conveyors in the supermarkets are cool and convenient.
