[{"categories":null,"content":" Three Major ReasonsBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, like most Chinese people, I had never visited Germany or any other European country. I had a travel plan that was unfortunately disrupted by the pandemic. So, why I’m willing to relocate to Germany? There are three major reasons. Curiosity about German industrial products and culture. Germany is renowned for “Made in Germany” products, e.g. cars. For a sustainable career. WLB(work-life balance) is not as common in China as it is in Germany, I don’t think the working style in China is sustainable for employees. For freedom. There is more freedom in Germany and people have more access to the Internet and other countries. Also, after a five-month stay in Germany between August 2023 and January 2024, I am pretty sure that I like living in Germany and I would love to relocate.

I have heard this before and confirmed this through my connections. There are so many jobs with WLB(work-life balance), which is not common in China. **This is also one of the most important reasons why I want to work in Germany. ** There are many more PTOs(Paid Time Off) in Germany than in China. There are so many remote/hybrid jobs, which is not common in China. Most employers in China require employees to work on-site. There are more possibilities. There are more chances to work in an international and diverse team. This sounds exciting to me. Most if not all interviews are conducted online, which is not so common in China especially after China removed its pandemic restrictions. And the working hours in a week are flexible and negotiable, which is unimaginable in China.

We became friends, and we still keep in touch. When I went to grocery stores, the cashiers were very polite and patient. When I was on a train/subway/bus, I could hear so many different languages. When my phone was dead and I asked for directions on a street, people were always helpful even if some of them didn’t speak English. When I walked with my friend on a street, I found fewer people than in China. I like it. There are too many people in China, especially in big cities.

Secondly, there are also many international fairs/exhibitions and tech conferences in Berlin and in Germany. During my stay, I visited IFA Berlin 2023. Thirdly, on major festivals, there are many activities to celebrate them. For example, I visited some places for the Festival of Lights, they were beautiful. I joined the gala at Brandenburg on New Year eve, the vibe was amazing. I also attended some Christmas Markets(Weihnachtsmarkt) to feel the vibe. If I can live in Germany, there will be many such things for me to explore.

And the sky is bluer too. I feel more comfortable than I do in China. The climate in Germany is more moderate than in North China, where I have spent the majority of my life so far. Germany has cooler summers and warmer winters and I got cold immediately when I returned to China. It was too cold in winter in North China. It gets dark earlier in winter here than in China, but it is not a problem for me. At night, I talk to my flatmates, eat out, walk around with my friends, or stay at home to relax.

This is so convenient because security checks can be very time-consuming, especially in big cities like Beijing in China, which can be super crowded. Germany’s compact size makes its cities highly accessible. I like it. I like the shared bikes on the street and I used them for a couple of times. I’m also curious about the shared scooters, but did not get a chance to use them. Situated in the heart of Europe, Germany offers easy access to other European countries. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to take advantage of this during my stay.

But I was so surprised to find that the food in Berlin is as diverse as its people. There are Chinese, Italian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Indian, and foods from many other countries and cultures. When it is possible, I dine out at restaurants with my friends. In most cases, Chinese food needs hot water and is very time-consuming. So, I don’t often cook in China and order take-out food. But they tend to be greasy and not healthy. And sometimes there are even food safety problems. Maybe you cannot imagine that I LOVE bread in Germany, especially Brezel and the buns. In China, most bread is sweet toasts. I like the fast food in Germany, e.g. sushi, rice boxes, pizza, and ready-to-go food. They are so convenient if you don’t want to cook. Although Germany has no 24/7 convenience stores like 7-Eleven, I think the grocery stores/supermarkets(e.g. Lidl, Edeka, Aldi, Rewe, Kaufland, dm) in Germany is good enough for shopping. The conveyors in the supermarkets are cool and convenient.
